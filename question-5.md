. A protocol is really nothing but a standard way of doing things.
If you were to meet the President of the United States, or the king of a country, 
there would be specific procedures that you'd have to follow. You couldn't just walk up and say "hey".
There would be a specific way to walk, to talk, a standard greeting, and a standard way to end the conversation. 
Protocols in the TCP/IP stack serve the same purpose.
The TCP/IP stack has four layers: Application, Transport, Internet, and Network. 
At each layer there are different protocols that are used to standardize the flow of information,
and each one is a computer program (running on your computer) that's used to format the information 
into a packet as it's moving down the TCP/IP stack. A packet is a combination of the Application Layer data, 
the Transport Layer header (TCP or UDP), and the IP layer header 
(the Network Layer takes the packet and turns it into a frame)
